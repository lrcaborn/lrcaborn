- 👋 Hi, I’m Rick Caborn (@lrcaborn)
- 👀 I’m interested in music and generating it programmatically.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to focus on the goal, not the tools.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing. I'm only a team player when I'm paid to be one.
- 📫 How to reach me: you're reading this, so you have found me.
